# Understanding-Android
A place for me to collect and share notes about everything Android

After forgetting a lot of the things I'd learnt when it comes to the build and support tools in Android, 
I got pretty frustrated with having to once again sort through the very fragmented notes available 
in the offical documentation and scattered elsewhere around the web. This is just my own attempt at 
curating what's useful and sorting out the junk. 

Making it available on Github, I hope that others will be able to help me keep things up to date as this picks up
speed. Who knows, maybe Google will scoop it up and use it in their official docs ;)

This guide would be aimed at people trying to do a little more than the very basic set-up that most of the 
how-to guides walk you through. This will be aimed at people working on large projects, who want to do heavy testing
and devide their projects up into multiple modules or libraries. 

I also hope to eventuall expand to other topics beyond just the build and support tools, like somethings 
hardware/firmware related, as well as all things software, although I find the documentation already available 
tends to be better for that, plus my experience is still limited!
